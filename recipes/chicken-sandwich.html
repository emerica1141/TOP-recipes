        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir together 1/2 cup pickle brine, 1 tablespoon salt, paprika, 1 teaspoon black pepper, <br>
                    cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small bowl. Place chicken thighs in a <br>
                    gallon-size ziplock plastic bag; pour in pickle brine mixture. Seal bag, and massage until <br>
                    chicken is evenly coated with brine mixture. Place in refrigerator; let marinate at least 2 hours <br>
                    or up to 8 hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>Whisk together buttermilk, 1/2 cup water, and egg in a large bowl. Remove chicken from brine; discard <br>
                    brine. Add chicken to buttermilk mixture. Whisk together flour, cornstarch, remaining 1 tablespoon <br>
                    salt, and remaining 1 tablespoon black pepper in shallow dish. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 200째F. Pour oil to a depth of 1/2 inch in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet; heat oil over medium to 350째F.</li>
                <li>Working in batches, remove 3 or 4 chicken thighs from buttermilk mixture, and place in flour mixture. Cover chicken with <br>
                    flour mixture, pressing to adhere. Lift from flour mixture, and gently shake off excess. Carefully place chicken in hot oil, <br>
                    taking care not to overcrowd skillet. Cook, adjusting heat as needed to maintain oil temperature of 350째F and turning <br>
                    every 1 to 2 minutes using tongs, until a thermometer inserted in thickest portion of thigh registers 165째F and breading is <br>
                    golden brown and very crispy, 6 to 8 minutes per batch. Remove chicken from skillet, and place on a wire rack set inside a <br>
                    rimmed baking sheet. Place in preheated oven to keep warm while repeating frying process with remaining chicken.</li>
                <li>Spread 1 heaping tablespoon mayonnaise onto cut sides of each bun. Arrange 5 to 6 pickle chips on each bun bottom; top with <br>
                    1 fried chicken thigh, 1/2 cup shredded lettuce, and, if desired, 1 tomato slice. Cover with bun tops.</li>
